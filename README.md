Learning and practicing known algorithms in javascript

--FizzBuzz(): - algorithm that console.logs out a list of numbers where each number 
    divisible by 3 returns "Fizz", each number divisble by 5 returns "Buzz", 
    and each number divisible by both 3 and 5 returns "FizzBuzz"

--BinarySearch(): - returns item user searches for or -1 if no item is found, 
    ostensibly keeps cutting collection in half until item is found - time complexity
    0 (log n)

--OddAppearance(listOfitems, 'odd' || 'even'): - given a list of items - print out the 
    items that appear and odd or even amount of times depending on type of argument 
    'odd' || 'even'

--RansomNote(): -function that takes two string arguments (msgText,magazineTxt) and searches
    if it's possible to construct desired message with the available words in the 
    magazineTxt string  - linear complexity - no nested for loops O(n)

--IsPalindrome(): basic checking of a palindrome given a string - does not take into account spaces, and special
    characters 

--CeasarCipher() - encryption and decryption function
